During the research phase of this project, I was motivated by faculty Travis Bradford’s work, titled the Solar Revolution. Bradford thinks that in the near future the direct solar energy will eclipse other fossil fuel based means of electricity production -not due to humane values but to economical concerns.
Currently, 121800 terawatts of energy is coming down to the surface of the earth after reflections and deflections are accounted for. If we were able to extract only 8% of that energy, it would supply the whole world’s energy need for a year.

Although current oil production has not peaked, BP the oil company, estimates that –at the current rate of consumption- the oil reserves in the world will deplete in 50 years. Compared to coal -which still has 132 more years to go-, oil is less detrimental to the environment as far as particles of toxins emitted per BTU. Driven both by the economical and environmental concerns of our future the Reno-TRIC High Trail aims to set an example for all future truck stops and gas stations to be built in the future.
By placing the individual over the highway the Reno-TRIC High Trail aims to offer a respite from the constantly moving network of logistics, transportation and acts of going from point A to point B. In essence, it removes you from the network and allows you to take a look at where you’ve been and where you will decide to go next. Yet this time –in the words of Lars Lerup- “the bridge is memory— it leads from the past into the future; while upon the bridge we may turn and catch a glimpse of the past.”
