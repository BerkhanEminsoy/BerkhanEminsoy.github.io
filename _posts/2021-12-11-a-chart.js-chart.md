Yes, yes and yes. One more day and one more chart making software package. Today I'm gonna test out chart.js. Wish me luck, but seems pretty easy. Just following the instructions on [chartjs.org](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/)

{% include /charts/chartjsChart.html %}

it works, setup as seen here. not too bad, but could be better :)
